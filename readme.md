## 📊 Visualization Screens

✔ Cost breakdown (stacked bars)
✔ Delivery reliability (SLA)
✔ Lead-time distribution
✔ Customer rating trend
✔ Route vs cost scatter
✔ Issue volume analysis
✔ Rating vs volume correlation plot
✔ Drill-down per issue → related orders table

## 🤖 Ops Copilot — Gemini AI

Ask in natural language:

> “What’s going on with order 87?”
> “Delay issues in Kolkata?”
> “What should we fix first?”

The Copilot will:

✅ Fuzzy match to correct Order_ID
✅ Retrieve linked ops + CX data
✅ Provide Summary + Cost View + Actions + Risks
✅ Cache responses to reduce cost
✅ Fallback to deterministic mode offline

## 🔥 Priority Insights (Top-N)

Automatically surfaces the **lowest-rated operational issue themes**, sorted by severity + frequency:

| Insight           | Example                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Root Causes       | lane/courier trends, packaging issues   |
| Immediate Actions | proactive ETA alerts, QA                |
| Structural Fixes  | barcode enforcement, carrier scorecards |
| KPI Monitoring    | SLA & Issue frequency                   |

📄 Export as **Issue Remediation Plan (PDF)**

## 🧮 Key Business Metrics

* Revenue recovered from SLA improvements
* Costs reduced by packaging SOP uplift
* Customer loyalty uplift via damage reduction
* Carrier & lane accountability via scorecards

ROI callout example:

> A 2% improvement in on-time performance →
> = ₹X saved / month + Y% more repeat purchases
