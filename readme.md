## 🤖 Ops Copilot — Gemini AI

<img width="1109" height="887" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 6 55 49 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80262e2a-9736-4a07-aa73-11c82f12c252" />


Ask in natural language:

> “What’s going on with order 87?”
> “Delay issues in Kolkata?”
> “What should we fix first?”

The Copilot will:

✅ Fuzzy match to correct Order_ID
✅ Retrieve linked ops + CX data
✅ Provide Summary + Cost View + Actions + Risks
✅ Cache responses to reduce cost
✅ Fallback to deterministic mode offline
